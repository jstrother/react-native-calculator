# react-native-calculator

This was built using Expo following the instructions in React Native's documentation [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html). If you haven't done so already, please follow those instructions before proceeding with this repo.

Once you have Expo ready to use on your computer and Android/iOS device, download this repo, run `expo start`, and scan the QR code with the Expo app on Android or the Camera app on iOS. You should see a calculator appear on your device that is ready to help you solve those math problems!

If you have any issues, please open an issue on this repo with as much detail as you can.
